# Latex Code for Neuromatch Stochastic Processes Summary Sheets

This repository contains the latex code to generate the Stochastic Processes Summary Sheets for [Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience Summer School 2022](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)

The code is divided by day:
+ Bayesian Decisions (W3D1)
+ Hidden Dynamics (W3D2)
+ Optimal Control (W3D3)
+ Reinforcement Learning (W3D4)
+ Network Causality (W3D5)

with the figures in the FIGURES folder.

All code was written using Overleaf below is the an example page.
